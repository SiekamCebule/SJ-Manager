# sj-manager
SJ Manager is a simulation game about ski jumping, heavily inspired by the Football Manager. The idea behind the game is to allow the user to become a manager of a ski jumping team, who is responsible for team management aspects. SJ Manager is supposed to faithfully reproduce the development of ski jumpers, participating in competitions, and other things, which determine the realism of the game.

## Main features
- Career mode, like that from Football Manager series (under development)
- Database editor, where you can change your jumpers, hills, calendars, competitions, and event series sets (under development)
- Large number of translations (under development)
- In a future, we are thinking of adding some accessibility features

## Technical aspects
- Written in Flutter.
