# sj-manager
SJ Manager is a simulation game about ski jumping, heavily inspired by the Football Manager. The idea behind the game is to allow the user to become a manager of a ski jumping team, who is responsible for team management aspects. SJ Manager is supposed to faithfully reproduce the development of ski jumpers, participating in competitions, and other things, which determine the realism of the game. Game is intended to be eventually avaiable on Windows and Linux platform.
